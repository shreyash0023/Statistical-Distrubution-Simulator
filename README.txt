CODE STRUCTURE
-----------------
1. All the distributions are implemented at different functions.
2. Make sure to name the correct distributions before running.
3. All the distributions give P(x=X) for the given parameters.
4. Bernoulli and Arbitrary discrete distributions only prints the final output of selecting the elements with the assigned probability.

HOW TO RUN THE CODE
--------------------

Command
-------
python simulateDist.py <number-of-samples> <distribution> <parameters> 

NOTE
----
The simulateDist should be in the same directory as at the terminal.
